# Tiny-Chess-Bot

Work done in this branch by @LukeKounkel 

Inital work is based on creating a dictionary where each move is a key and it's assigned an integer "value"
then choose to make the move with the highest point value.

Commit 1-3: V1.0 - Base version - 248/1024 tokens

	Wrote a simple set of nested for loops based on EvilBot's structure but with an extra check for the next opponent move
	A proof of concept if the dictionary{move: value, ...} idea would work, and it does!
	After 50 games the score was +19 =28 -3
